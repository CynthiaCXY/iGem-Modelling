Try `5`, `10`, `50`, `100`, `200`, `500`, `1000`, `1500` and `2000` and test the classifier on the test set. How does the k parameter effect the results? *Hint: Consider how well the classifier is generalising to previously unseen data, and how it compares to the base rate again.*"

    "Read about the [logarithimic loss](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.log_loss.html) (or cross-entropy loss) metric which is often used in neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "This metric takes as input the true labels and the estimated probability distributions (bernouli or multinomial). It makes sense to use this metric when we are interested not only in the predicted labels, but also in the confidence (i.e. probability) that these are predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, think of the situation where you have a single test point and two classifiers. Both classifiers predict the label correctly, however classifier A predicts tha the test point belongs to the class with probability 0.55, whereas classifier B predicts the correct class with probability 0.99. Classification accuracy would be the same for the two classifiers (why?) but the `log_loss`  metric would indicate that classifier B should be favoured.\n",
    "\n",
    "Produce a scatter plot similar to the one in Question 2.10 but this time show `log_loss` on your y axis. Which value for `k` would you pick if `log_loss` was your metric of interest?"

Nevertheless `sklearn` does provide a `predict_proba()` method which returns probability estimates on predictions by using cross-validation."
